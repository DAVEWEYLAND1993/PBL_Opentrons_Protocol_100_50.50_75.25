# Opentrons Bioprocessing Protocol for Light-Sensitive Hydrogels

This repository contains an automated Opentrons protocol for preparing and optimising light-sensitive biomaterials such as GelMA, HA-NB, and PEGDA. These biomaterials are synthesised in various weight % ratios (%w/v) - 10%, 5%-5%, 7.5%-2.5%

## 🧪 Project Highlights:
- Automated dispensing of hydrogels using Opentrons liquid handling robot with precision pipetting techniques.
- Advanced offset mixing strategies for thorough blending of viscous solutions.
- Custom labware integration (custom microwells, custom reservoir).
- Temperature-controlled synthesis for maintaining material stability.

## ⚙️ Protocol Setup:
1. **Labware:**
   - Opentrons 96 Filter Tip Racks (20 µL)
   - Opentrons PCR 96-well aluminum block
   - Custom reservoirs for GelMA, HA-NB, PEGDA
2. **Modules:**
   - Temperature Module GEN2 (Slots 1 & 4)
3. **Pipette:**
   - P20 8-Channel GEN2 Pipette

## 🚀 How to Run the Protocol:
1. Upload the protocol to your OT-2 robot via the Opentrons App.
2. Follow on-screen instructions for manual interventions during the process.
3. Adjust pipetting speeds and volumes as needed for different materials.
